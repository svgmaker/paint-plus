An improved version of Paint for XP. The end goal for this project is to turn this into a more feature-rich version of Paint. Screenshots and features below.

## DEVELOPERS WANTED!!
If you or a friend knows C++ please contribute by working on the roadmap below.

## Features:

Working things:

- Zoom past 1000x with a custom zoom by going to View > Zoom > 1000x zoom. There isn't a limit! (i think) 
- Triangle tool (bugged but sort of works)
- Toolbar for quick access to menu commands
- Font shadow
- New icons (I will make modern ones soon)

A possible roadmap:

- GIF transparency (will require office 97 for some reason)
- Toolbox shortcuts - [m] for square selection, [z] for zoom etc
- Icon stamp tool
- Visual Styles buttons to get system-looking buttons.

Impossible roadmap:

- WEBP support
