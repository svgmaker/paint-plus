# paint-plus
An improved version of Paint for XP. Screenshots and features below.

## DEVELOPERS WANTED!!
If you or a friend knows C++ please contribute by working on the broken things section down below.

## Features:

Working things:

- New icon for paintbrush because why not
- Zoom past 1000x by going to View > Zoom > 1000x zoom...
- Small spray paint icon is amogus, it doesn't actually spray an among us character but it WILL in the future!

Broken things (devs wanted):

- Cursed icon underneath the circle tool - it is supposed to be a triangle tool but it's a WIP. If you know C++, please contribute!
- Image > Attributes shows the "Use transparent background color" option. It only is active when you are editing a GIF and it doesn't work...
- I can't save any image as a GIF on Windows 10 but we only have to start caring about that when we get transparent bg color working.

The end goal for this project is to turn this into a more feature-rich version of Paint.
